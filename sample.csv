1, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,1,5,1,I was prescribed this for the nerve pain that accompanies shingles. This did nothing for my pain. It just made me loopy! There has to be better medications for people with nerve pain. Not to mention that thanks to the addicts you can only get a three day supply so while you're in so much pain you can't drive you have to keep going back for a new script.,NA
2, Ocetech| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,1,4,2,Tramadol does help a bit with the ghost pain in my hand but| it does absolutely nothing for my chronic sciatic  pain in my right leg.|,Male
3, virleo| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,1,1,1,A few years ago a doctor at an urgent care clinic prescribed this for a bad tooth infection that flared up over a weekend. I had to sign some sort of paper before leaving the office and then hand-deliver the prescription to my pharmacy. How disappointing it was to find that Tramadol didn't even touch the pain. It seemed to have NO effect whatsoever. The medications prescribed by my dentist - Vicodin and Penicillin VK - did help ease the pain until the infection was cleared up. Throughout my life I haven't needed to take much medication for severe pain| but when I have needed something| Vicodin and Percocet have been so effective that I've usually taken only half the dosage prescribed.,Female

5, Mtdwnurse1| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,4,4,4,"After my neck fusion to my cervical C5|6|7| bone spur removal| and spinal stenosis plus suffering from ankylosing spondylitis I was on dilaudid for 2 weeks post op| at my 2 week follow up I asked to taper to percocet| several weeks later I then asked to taper to tramadol and Celebrex. 9 months later my neck feels better but living with AS| which there is no cure| can be debilitating. The occasional tramadol and daily Celebrex have worked wonders for me at this time. Prior to my cervical fusion 4 years prior I had a Lumbar L4-5 fusion which finally has healed as well. Tramadol may not be for everyone or work on everyone but I've had good results. You have to figure out what least amount of mind alternating drug works for you. If it's truly for pain that a person is taking it for it should bind to the pain receptors and help with the pain. If it's not for pain then it doesn't have a receptor to bind to causing a ""high"". If it doesn't work the receptor in your brain may need a different medication to bind to| to help relieve the pain you are having. Remember there are many different medications for this reason. And always remember it's usually not likely to have ""0-10"" pain rating. Most people have pain and suffering of some sort and everyone reacts to pain differently then the next person. I've been giving pills to people for 20  years as a nurse as well and never once have seen tramadol have negative side effects such as: seizures| etc. Hope this helps.. :)",Female

12, TXBONNIEBELLE| 65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,1,1,1,I asked my doctor for pain relief that was stronger than Aleve but not a narcotic.  I have DDD (degenerative disc disease) and severe pain in my back.  Dr prescribed 50mg of Tramadol 3xday.  Useless.  Absolutely useless.  Two Aleve work better for pain relief.

15, Allison | 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,4,4,I have been diagnosed with so many issues. Iâ??ve been on Tramadol for years now and it helps with my chronic pain. Iâ??ve been trying to wean myself off this drug like I did with a drug called Gabapentin. So Iâ??ve been breaking them in half. My 4 a Day is down to 3. But I read a review from someone who enlightened me greatly. I too have right-sided STABBING abdominal pain for almost 5 years now and FINALLY| after 11 specialists| been diagnosed with Myofascial pelvic floor pain. My stretches from PT help GREATLY! But could my abdominal pain be from Tramadol? OMG| I wish I could be sure. Tramadol helps with my fibromyalgia pain. Also| taking an Aleve once in a while helps too. But I try| EVERY SINGLE DAY| to push through the pain to be more active. We just have to move but moving is painful. Iâ??ve been treadmilling 30 minutes almost daily and I weight train whenever I can. Chronic pain sucks. Keep thinking positive thoughts though. Please donâ??t give up!,NA

26, Ban Tramadol| 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,1,1,1,DO NOT USE THIS DANGEROUS MEDICINE!! I can't believe this medicine is still on the market. I was prescribed this med back in 2002/2003 for pain after surgery| it didn't work and made me feel worse then I did before I took it. Stomach pain|nausea|vomiting and severe headaches. The worst part though were the grand-mal seizures I had while taking this medication.They would come out of nowhere| without any warning signs. Before tramadol I'd NEVER had a seizure| but while on it I had 3. Not small ones either| but the type that had my family calling 911. The only thing I remember is waking up in ambulance| emergency room and at home with emts surrounding me. I was on 2 other medications at the time| so my Dr started taking me off of the others| one at a time| to find out what medication| if any| was causing the seizures. Tramadol was the last one remaining and I had my 2nd and 3rd seizure while being on it alone. Another thing is that my 19 year old daughter was also taking it for an awful toothache and had a grand-mal seizure right in front of me a day before I had my final one.,NA

I realize tramadol is addicting| too| so I only take it when it's absolutely necessary for the pain. I gave it a 4 because most of the time it has worked well| except for about 2 times. I have not had any side effects or problems taking it.,Female

151, Paratrooper| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,3,4,3,"Took Tramadol 7 years ago and caused headaches and some itching.  I recently went off a low dose of hydrocodone/tylenol ( 5/325  twice daily) that I had been on for 6 months following extensive surgery to repair upper fibula/tibia joint.     No head aches or itching thus far taking the Tramadol 50 mg twice daily.   I have heard the withdrawal stories but believe some are more susceptible than others! And everyone is different.  Tramadol is definitely not an immediate substitute for real opiate pain relievers. Doc wanted me off hydrocodone for two weeks before starting tram!adol!   After going off Hrydrocodone I did experience some discomfort for a week.....unexpectedly because I had been on 4 times that amount for four years.... a few years before the ""opiate hysteria era"" started and tapered off without discomfort.   Docs prefer to use Tramadol (schedule III) which can be written with refills vs Hydrocodone even if warranted due to no refill thanks to now being schedule II.   So far Tramadol's only side effect is a little dry mouth and some slight drowsiness!    Pain relief is about 50% of a 5/325 hydrocodone.....but that's better than nothing and good enough for full function.!!",Male

I picked up my prescription & noticed these were different than the ones I've always gotten| they were Ultram (377) oblongs. Once these kicked in| I noticed significant pain reduction along with euphoria I hadn't experienced in years due to being in pain they didn't upset my stomach| make me nauseous or add an additional headache!

It was great with helping with pain until i went into a flair of my illness. Have been ill with what we thought was a severe concussion from fainting due to being in to much pain and not speaking out about it. After 3 week's of confusion| headache's| and other unusual side affect's my doctor discovered i actually have what they call Serotonin Syndrome because there is an interaction between taking Tramadol and Mirtazapine that i was also taking for my depression.  No-one before now has picked up on this. I'd been taking both together for at least 2 years. So I am now weaning off the Tramadol and have to try a different approach to pain relief as i also need to keep taking the Mirtazapine for my depression. If I didn't need to take the antidepressant then i would stay on the Tramadol for shore because it did work great with the pain. Hope this info help's.,Female

362, Thankful one| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,3,5,2,I have taken this medication for nearly ten years off & on for chronic pain issues related to injuries from a car accident| fibromyalgia| endometriosis etc. Most recently I was on a max dosage of 400mg daily finding myself always waiting & looking forward to my next dose. I ran out of this med on a friday & requested a refill through my doctor's on call service. They refused - I was devastated - had the worst most horrible withdrawal for 4-5 days. I am glad I am off this medication now. I have been trying to use otc meds sparingly along with 1-3 Lyrica daily & cymbalta (have taken both for years as well). I still have mild to severe pain at times - sometimes all throughout the day -  especially at night. The good part - I don't feel the need to take meds every 4-6 hours like I have -daily- for years. I feel pain & sometimes I can even function without meds - it's totally new to me. Don't get me wrong - I have to takes breaks while working. I have to lie down for breaks sometimes. Sometimes pain causes me to walk so slow at work people ask if I am okay - I just try to answer with a positive attitude & gather my strength to keep moving without reaching for meds. I am managing okay.  I could not have said this while on tramadol because I always needed the next dose & an hour after ingestion to feel good enough to get moving & mentally feel better. Do I think I was addicted? YES! Mind you - I never abused the med. I never took against the Rx directions. (I even refused to take the vicodin & percocet I have had in the medicine cabinet because I never wanted to become dependent on them.)  I was mortified when my doctor decided not to refill this med for me - but - I am so grateful for this. THE WITHDRAWAL WAS HORRIBLE. I really wish they would have let me titrate down though. (Perhaps I never would have realized the negative effects this drug had on my life though.) I am glad to be off tramadol & would warn anyone against taking the higher doses of this med regularly. |,Female

582, joel| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,3,3,1,I was prescribed 50mg tramadol 3x a day for pain due to degenerative discs in my neck. The doc said it was a mild pain reliever and good for managing long term pain issues. It helped somewhat| enough for me to continue it's use for years but after about 3 years I started to feel unwell. I was getting terrible jitters and having problems sleeping. My heart rate and blood pressure remained normal but inside I felt like I had consumed a dozen double espressos. I couldn't sleep without medication. I thought it was stress related and it took months for me to determine that my body was craving more tramadol. It was as though I walked through a physiological doorway and while the medication helped with the pain in my neck| the amount I was taking daily was not enough to satisfy my physical need for it. I tried to wean myself on my own and the withdrawal was horrendous.I finally broke down and saw my personal physician| not the doc who prescribed the medication and I have been on a several month process of weaning myself. I haven't had any tramadol in several weeks and still feel jittery but I can see the end I think. I am sleeping better but still need medication to do so. The process has been REALLY difficult for me and my family. I'm writing this to warn anyone thinking of using this pain killer to think twice before doing so. If you ask this medical professionals this should not be happening but tramadol acts like an opioid though it isn't technically and it's a bear to stop after long term use. Go on Google before starting and read about people's experiences with tramadol withdrawal. I wish I had.,Male

Last year I tried chiropractic and acupuncture with minimum results| it eliminated the muscle spasms but still have the stiffness and lower back pain.  This year I went to the same surgeon and the dr prescribed Baclofen| 10mg along with Tramadol HCL 50mg 3x’s per day as an initial therapy along with stretching to see if it will eliminate the back pain.  Initially the meds relieved the pain in my shoulder and hip but minimum relief in lower back (same area as previous surgery) and the mid back region is still a problem (feels like the onset of muscle spasms without the spasms).  After 2 wks| shoulder and hip pain are still gone| lower back still hurts and stiff but only a dull ache instead of constant pain and mid back is bothersome. side effects are; constipation| problem urinating (stream not as hard and going more often) and reduced sexual functions (this alone will stop me from taking the meds).  ||I will continue taking for 30 days along with the stretching and then decide if I want to continue taking the meds.
